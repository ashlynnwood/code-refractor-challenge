# Code Refractor Challenge

## Description
The Horieson website's code was refractored to make the website more accessible for every user. This was done by adding alt attributes for each image and icon, consolidating the CSS selectors and reorganizing them to follow the order of the HTML elements, checking the functionality of each link, and adding HTML and CSS comments.
